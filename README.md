# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub – Yael Solan

I am a career changer (Quereinsteigerin) with a background in political science and a strong passion for technology, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. I am currently transitioning into the tech industry through intensive self-learning, courses, and hands-on projects.

This portfolio showcases a selection of my personal projects in Python, AI, and data analysis – developed as part of my preparation for a Duales Studium or Ausbildung in IT and Software Development in Germany.
